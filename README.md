# DayZ_Loot_Categorized
DayZ Loot Categorized 

This is my customized DayZ Loot table. Which is the Type.xml file. I categorized the file so it would help me to customize my loot spawn faster. This file is untouched and by that i mean that nothing is modified or any other item added. This is what came with server file except that i categorized it to my liking.

Instruction:
**Download** the file.

Go to your **server directory.**

Go to **mpmission.**

Go to **your mission.**

Go to **db**.

**Paste** the file and **replace** your type.xml

**Always** make **backup** first.

EX:
Military Clothing

Civilian Clothing

Tools

Weapons

You get the point

I will update this when DayZ updates add's more item to the list.

I also want to add at the top the line so we can go to it faster.
